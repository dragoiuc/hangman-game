This is my first attempt at programming a real project. 
I'm following along with the EECS 280 introduction to C++ website: https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/Intro_C%2B%2B.html
On a side note, this project shares very little in terms of similarity to the code provided in the aforementioned website.
This is because I wanted to tackle this project only by using my own abilities.

As of now, this program is currently finished and likely won't be revisted in the future as the code will likely never see daylight.
An earlier iteration of the project can found under hangman.0
The final version of the project can be found under main.cpp

Thanks for reading!
Cristian Out!
